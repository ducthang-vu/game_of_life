                    Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input.

                    In this implementation, the field is a 150x100 grid, which is also a toroid. On the page load, the grid shall be populated by a random number of cell (approximately 40% of the grid). This constitutes the seed of the system.
